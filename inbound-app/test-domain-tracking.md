# Domain Tracking Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed
The main issue was in `app/api/v2/domains/[id]/route.ts` - the DELETE handler was missing Autumn usage tracking.

## What Was Missing
When users deleted domains through the V2 API endpoint (`DELETE /api/v2/domains/{id}`), the domain would be deleted from the database and AWS SES, but the usage counter in Autumn was never decremented. This caused users to eventually reach their domain limit even after deleting domains.

## Fix Applied
Added Autumn tracking to the V2 API DELETE handler:

```typescript
// 7. Track domain deletion with Autumn to free up domain spot
try {
    console.log('üìä Tracking domain deletion with Autumn for user:', userId)
    const { Autumn: autumn } = await import('autumn-js')
    const { error: trackError } = await autumn.track({
        customer_id: userId,
        feature_id: "domains",
        value: -1,
    })

    if (trackError) {
        console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to track domain deletion:', trackError)
        // Don't fail the deletion if tracking fails, just log it
        console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Domain deleted but usage tracking failed for user: ${userId}`)
    } else {
        console.log(`‚úÖ Successfully tracked domain deletion for user: ${userId}`)
    }
} catch (trackingError) {
    console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to import or use Autumn tracking:', trackingError)
    // Don't fail the deletion if tracking fails, just log it
}
```

## Domain Operations Status
‚úÖ **Working Correctly:**
- `app/actions/domains.ts` - `addDomain()` (tracks +1)
- `app/actions/domains.ts` - `deleteDomain()` (tracks -1)
- `app/api/domain/verifications/route.ts` - `handleAddDomain()` (tracks +1)
- `app/api/domain/verifications/route.ts` - `handleDeleteDomain()` (tracks -1)
- `app/api/v2/domains/route.ts` - `POST` (tracks +1)
- `app/api/v2/domains/[id]/route.ts` - `DELETE` (NOW FIXED: tracks -1)

## Testing Steps
1. Check current domain count with Autumn
2. Add a domain through any endpoint
3. Verify count increased by 1
4. Delete the domain through the V2 API endpoint
5. Verify count decreased by 1
6. Confirm user can add domains up to their limit

## Impact
This fix ensures that users who delete domains through the V2 API will have their usage counter properly decremented, preventing the "zero domains available" issue.
