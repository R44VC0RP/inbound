<img width="2912" height="1363" alt="Frame 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9ca6121-869c-4a00-84fb-24e5c08207bc" />

**Stop juggling email providers. Start building.**

Inbound gives you programmable email addresses that automatically process incoming messages and trigger webhooks in your app. Think of it as email infrastructure that actually works the way you'd want it to.

## What does it do?

### üì® **Receive Emails Programmatically**
Create email addresses on-the-fly through our API. When someone sends an email to `support@yourdomain.com`, we'll parse it and instantly webhook your app with the full message content.

```javascript
// Create an email address
const response = await inbound.emailAddresses.create({
  address: "support@yourdomain.com",
  webhookUrl: "https://yourapp.com/handle-email"
})

// When emails arrive, you'll get webhooks like:
{
  "event": "email.received",
  "email": {
    "from": "customer@example.com",
    "subject": "Help with my account",
    "textBody": "I can't log into my account...",
    "htmlBody": "<p>I can't log into my account...</p>",
    "attachments": [...],
    "headers": {...}
  }
}
```

### üîÑ **Email Forwarding**
Forward emails to existing addresses or other services. Perfect for routing customer emails to your team or integrating with external tools.

### üéØ **Smart Routing**
Route emails with flexible mixed mode - configure specific email addresses for known patterns and catch-all for everything else. Send support emails to your helpdesk, billing emails to your finance team, and everything else to a catch-all endpoint. Works like a switch-case with default in your favorite programming language.

## üöÄ Coming Soon

### üíé **Inbound VIP**
Pay-per-email premium routing for high-value communications. Skip the noise, get only the emails that matter with smart filtering and priority delivery.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Inbound Support**
Built-in ticketing and customer support workflows. Turn any email address into a support center with automatic ticket creation, assignment, and tracking.

### üìß **Remail in SDK**
Send emails directly through the same infrastructure. One API for both sending and receiving emails, with automatic reply-to handling and conversation threading.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the SDK
```bash
npm install @inboundemail/sdk
# or
bun add @inboundemail/sdk
```

### 2. Initialize with your API key
```javascript
import { Inbound } from '@inboundemail/sdk'

// Get your API key from inbound.new
const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY)
```

### 3. Add a domain
```javascript
const domain = await inbound.domains.create({
  domain: "yourdomain.com"
})

console.log("Domain added:", domain.domain)
```

### 4. Create an email address
```javascript
const emailAddress = await inbound.emailAddresses.create({
  address: "hello@yourdomain.com",
  webhookUrl: "https://yourapp.com/webhook/email"
})

console.log("Email address created:", emailAddress.address)
```

### 5. Start receiving emails
Send an email to `hello@yourdomain.com` and watch your webhook fire with the parsed content.

## Local Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/R44VC0RP/inbound
cd inbound
bun install

# Prepare `.env` variables
cp inbound-app/.env.example inbound-app/.env.local

# Ensure inbound-app/.env.local has a valid DATABASE_URL:
# For example:
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/inbound?schema=public"

# Setup db
bun run db-prepare
# Start the dev server
bun run dev

# Test email webhooks locally (no AWS needed)
bun run inbound-webhook-test test@yourdomain.com
```

## SDK Usage

```javascript
import { Inbound } from '@inboundemail/sdk'

const inbound = new Inbound(process.env.INBOUND_API_KEY)

// Create email addresses
const emailAddress = await inbound.emailAddresses.create({
  address: 'support@yourdomain.com',
  webhookUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/handle-support'
})

// List received emails
const emails = await inbound.mail.list()

// Get full email content
const email = await inbound.mail.get(emailId)

// Reply to emails (coming soon with ReEmail)
await inbound.mail.reply(emailId, {
  subject: 'Re: Your support request',
  body: 'Thanks for reaching out...'
})
```
