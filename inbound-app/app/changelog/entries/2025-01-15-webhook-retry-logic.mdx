version: 1.9.0
summary: Implemented intelligent retry logic for webhook deliveries with exponential backoff, improving reliability for webhook endpoints experiencing temporary issues.
---

## What's New

We've implemented a robust retry mechanism for webhook deliveries to ensure your applications receive email notifications even when experiencing temporary connectivity issues.

## Key Improvements

### ðŸ”„ Automatic Retry Logic
- Failed webhook deliveries are now automatically retried up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff between retries (1s, 4s, 16s)
- Prevents overwhelming your servers during recovery

### ðŸ“Š Enhanced Delivery Tracking
- New webhook delivery status tracking in the dashboard
- View retry attempts and failure reasons
- Real-time webhook health monitoring

### âš¡ Performance Optimizations
- Parallel webhook delivery for multiple endpoints
- Reduced latency for successful deliveries
- Better handling of timeout scenarios

## Configuration Options

You can now configure webhook behavior per endpoint:

```javascript
{
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  "timeout": 30000,        // Custom timeout (ms)
  "retryAttempts": 3,      // Number of retry attempts
  "retryDelay": 1000       // Initial retry delay (ms)
}
```

## Webhook Response Requirements

To ensure proper retry behavior, your webhook endpoint should:
- Return 2xx status codes for successful processing
- Return 5xx status codes for temporary failures (will retry)
- Return 4xx status codes for permanent failures (won't retry)

## Monitoring

New metrics available in your dashboard:
- Webhook success rate
- Average delivery time
- Retry attempt distribution
- Failed delivery reasons

This update requires no changes to your existing webhook endpoints and is fully backward compatible.
