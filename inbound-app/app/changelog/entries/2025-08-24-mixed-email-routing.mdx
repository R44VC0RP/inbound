title: Mixed Email Routing - Specific Addresses + Catch-All
date: 2025-08-24
version: 1.10.0
summary: Configure different webhooks for specific email addresses while having a catch-all for everything else
---

## Overview

We've enhanced our email routing system to support mixed routing configurations. You can now configure specific email addresses to route to different webhooks while maintaining a catch-all webhook for all other emails to your domain. This works like a switch statement in programming.

## What Changed

### Infrastructure Updates
- Enhanced email routing logic with clear priority system
- Improved logging to show routing decisions
- Better support for simultaneous specific and catch-all configurations

### SDK Enhancement (v4.1.0)
- Added new `configureMixedRouting()` method for easy setup
- Simplified configuration of complex routing scenarios
- Full TypeScript support for routing configuration

### API Improvements
- Existing endpoints already support mixed routing
- Clear priority: specific email → catch-all → no routing
- No breaking changes to existing configurations

## How It Works

The routing system follows this priority:

```
switch (email) {
  case 'support@domain.com':
    → support webhook
  case 'sales@domain.com':
    → sales webhook
  default: // catch-all
    → catch-all webhook
}
```

## SDK Usage

```typescript
const { data } = await inbound.configureMixedRouting({
  domain: 'yourdomain.com',
  routes: {
    'support@yourdomain.com': 'https://api.example.com/support',
    'sales@yourdomain.com': 'https://api.example.com/sales',
  },
  catchAll: 'https://api.example.com/catch-all'
})
```

## Benefits

- **Flexible Routing**: Route different departments to different systems
- **Catch-All Safety**: Never miss an email with catch-all fallback
- **Easy Management**: Configure everything in one API call
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing configurations continue to work

## Migration Guide

No migration needed! Your existing configurations will continue to work exactly as before. The new mixed routing is an enhancement that you can adopt when needed.

To start using mixed routing:

1. Update to SDK v4.1.0 or use the API directly
2. Call `configureMixedRouting()` with your desired configuration
3. Test with a few emails to verify routing

## Technical Details

The routing priority system ensures predictable behavior:
1. **Specific email address** takes highest priority
2. **Catch-all** handles everything else for the domain
3. **No routing** if neither is configured (email is stored but not forwarded)

This allows maximum flexibility while maintaining simplicity and predictability.
