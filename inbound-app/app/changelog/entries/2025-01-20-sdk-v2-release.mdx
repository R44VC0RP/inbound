---

## Overview

We're excited to announce SDK v2, a complete overhaul of the `@inboundemail/sdk` that brings comprehensive API coverage, an improved developer experience, and powerful new features for handling email workflows.

## Key Features

### üöÄ New Client Structure
The SDK now uses a cleaner, more intuitive structure:

```javascript
import { Inbound } from '@inboundemail/sdk'

const inbound = new Inbound('your-api-key')
```

### üìß Streamlined Email Replies
Replying to emails has never been easier, especially from webhook handlers:

```javascript
// Simple reply with default settings
await inbound.reply(webhookEmail, "Thanks for your message!")

// Reply with custom from address
await inbound.reply(webhookEmail, {
  from: "support@company.com",
  text: "Thanks for reaching out!"
})

// Full control over the reply
await inbound.reply(webhookEmail, {
  from: "support@company.com",
  subject: "Re: Your inquiry",
  html: "<p>Thanks for your message!</p>",
  attachments: [...]
})
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive API Coverage

#### Emails API (Sending)
```javascript
// Send emails
const email = await inbound.emails.send({
  from: "hello@example.com",
  to: "recipient@example.com",
  subject: "Hello!",
  html: "<p>Email content</p>"
})

// Get email details
const details = await inbound.emails.get(emailId)
```

#### Mail API (Received Emails)
```javascript
// List received emails
const emails = await inbound.mail.list()

// Get specific email
const email = await inbound.mail.get(emailId)
```

#### Endpoints API
Full CRUD operations for webhook endpoints:
```javascript
const endpoint = await inbound.endpoints.create({
  url: "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  description: "Production webhook"
})

await inbound.endpoints.update(endpointId, { url: newUrl })
await inbound.endpoints.delete(endpointId)
```

#### Domains API
Complete domain management:
```javascript
const domains = await inbound.domains.list()
const domain = await inbound.domains.create({ domain: "example.com" })
await inbound.domains.updateCatchAll(domainId, { enabled: true })
```

### üîí Enhanced TypeScript Support
All methods are fully typed with comprehensive TypeScript definitions:

```typescript
import type { 
  InboundWebhookPayload,
  InboundWebhookEmail,
  CreateEndpointParams,
  Domain
} from '@inboundemail/sdk'
```

### ü™ù Webhook Helpers
New utilities for processing webhook data:

```javascript
import { isInboundWebhook, getSenderInfo, getEmailText } from '@inboundemail/sdk'

// Validate webhook payload
if (isInboundWebhook(payload)) {
  const sender = getSenderInfo(payload.email)
  const text = getEmailText(payload.email)
}
```

## Migration Guide

Upgrading from v1? Here's what changed:

1. **Client initialization**: `InboundEmailClient` ‚Üí `Inbound`
2. **Email sending**: `client.sendEmail()` ‚Üí `inbound.emails.send()`
3. **New features**: Reply functionality, mail retrieval, endpoint management

## What's Next

We're continuously improving the SDK. Coming soon:
- Batch operations support
- Advanced filtering for email lists
- Webhook signature verification helpers
