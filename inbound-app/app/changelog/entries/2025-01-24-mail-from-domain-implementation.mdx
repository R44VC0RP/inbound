title: MAIL FROM Domain Implementation
date: 2025-01-24
version: 1.10.0
summary: Automatic MAIL FROM domain setup eliminates "via amazonses.com" attribution for enhanced email deliverability
---

## Overview
We've implemented automatic MAIL FROM domain configuration to eliminate the "via amazonses.com" attribution that appears in email clients, significantly improving email deliverability and professional appearance.

## What Changed
- **Automatic Setup**: All new domains now automatically configure MAIL FROM domains (`mail.yourdomain.com`)
- **Upgrade Option**: Existing domains can be upgraded with a single click to add MAIL FROM configuration
- **Enhanced DNS Records**: Additional MX and SPF records are automatically generated for MAIL FROM domains
- **Status Tracking**: New database fields track MAIL FROM domain verification status
- **API Enhancements**: Domain creation and management APIs now include MAIL FROM domain information

## Technical Details

### New DNS Records
When you add or upgrade a domain, these additional records are now generated:
```
Type: MX
Name: mail.yourdomain.com
Value: 10 feedback-smtp.us-east-2.amazonses.com

Type: TXT
Name: mail.yourdomain.com
Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all
```

### API Changes
The `/api/v2/domains` endpoints now include:
```json
{
  "mailFromDomain": "mail.example.com",
  "mailFromDomainStatus": "Success",
  "mailFromDomainVerifiedAt": "2025-01-24T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Database Schema
New fields added to `email_domains` table:
- `mailFromDomain`: The configured MAIL FROM domain
- `mailFromDomainStatus`: Verification status ('pending', 'verified', 'failed', 'not_set')
- `mailFromDomainVerifiedAt`: Timestamp when MAIL FROM domain was verified

## Impact

### For New Domains
- MAIL FROM domains are automatically configured during domain creation
- No additional action required from users
- Enhanced deliverability from day one

### For Existing Domains
- Upgrade button available in domain management interface
- One-click upgrade to add MAIL FROM configuration
- Additional DNS records provided for manual setup

### Email Deliverability Benefits
- Eliminates "via amazonses.com" attribution in Gmail, Outlook, and other email clients
- Improves sender reputation and trust
- Reduces likelihood of emails being marked as spam
- Professional appearance with your own domain in sender information

## Migration Guide

### Existing Domain Owners
1. Navigate to your domain management page
2. Look for domains without MAIL FROM configuration
3. Click "Upgrade Identity" button for enhanced deliverability
4. Add the provided DNS records to your domain provider
5. Wait for verification (usually within 24 hours)

### DNS Provider Setup
Add these records to your DNS provider:
1. **MX Record**: `mail.yourdomain.com` → `10 feedback-smtp.us-east-2.amazonses.com`
2. **TXT Record**: `mail.yourdomain.com` → `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing domains continue to work without changes
- MAIL FROM upgrade is optional but recommended
- No breaking changes to existing API endpoints
- Graceful fallback to default behavior if MAIL FROM setup fails

## Next Steps
- Monitor MAIL FROM domain verification status in your dashboard
- Upgrade existing domains for improved deliverability
- Contact support if you encounter any issues with DNS setup

This enhancement significantly improves the professional appearance and deliverability of emails sent through our platform while maintaining full backward compatibility.
