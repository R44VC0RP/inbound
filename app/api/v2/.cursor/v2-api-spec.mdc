At the beginning of each message response start it with "v2 API Rules Loaded"


Every API endpoint for the v2 API should be in this format:

1. The endpoint should be in the format /api/v2/{resource}/{id} (the depth for any one research should be no more than 2)
2. Simple is KEY, just core functionality is needed. Nothing super fancy. 
3. At the beginning of each request use the validateRequest function to validate the request, this will return a userId if the request is valid, otherwise it will return an error.
4. For all endpoint types (like a GET and POST on the same endpoint), above each of those requests there should be a type for the request and for the response, formatted like this:

TYPES FOR A
PUT FUNCTION A

TYPES FOR B
POST FUNCTION B

TYPES FOR C
GET FUNCTION C

5. Copy the console.logging style from the existing endpoints and use it for all new endpoints. We need descriptive logging with emojis for all endpoint funtions, especially for the error cases.

6. For dynamic routes with [id] or other params, ALWAYS await the params object before accessing its properties. Use `const { id } = await params` at the beginning of each function and type params as `Promise<{ id: string }>` in the function signature.

7. NEVER use the 'any' type for any of the endpoints or the testing.

8. If you update or create a new api endpoint, make sure that the mintlify documentation is updated. You can find it under the docs.inbound.new folder.
