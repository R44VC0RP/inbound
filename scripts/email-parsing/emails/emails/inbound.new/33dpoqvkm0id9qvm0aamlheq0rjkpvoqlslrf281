  Hi there,=20

The usecase for this will be for email routing and forwarding the transacti=
onal emails.

The setup/implementation is for the site called inbound.exon.dev. Users can=
 add + verify a domain to recieve inbound emails then in the console they c=
an setup to go to a webhook or another email (like forwarding essentially).=
 I need to be able to send as those verified identities so that I can have =
the routing be smooth and come from the email that it was sent too.=20

So for example if you email ryan@inbound.amazon.com it will go to the site =
and if you have a routing rule setup where it will forard all requests to j=
ohn@amazon.com the email incoming to john@amazon.com will be from ryan@inbo=
und.amazon.com

For most usecases unsubscribe bouncing and such is handled via the email th=
at is actually sending. Inbound acts as an invisibile gateway.=20

Inbound sending via SES will not be used for marketing or newsletters.=20
