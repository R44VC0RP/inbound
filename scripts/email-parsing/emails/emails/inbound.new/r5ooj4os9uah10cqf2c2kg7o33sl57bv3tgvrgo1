Hello,

Thank you for submitting your request to increase your sending limits. Your=
 new sending quota is 50,000 messages per day. Your maximum send rate is no=
w 14 messages per second. We have also moved your account out of the Amazon=
 SES sandbox.

This takes effect immediately in the US East (Ohio) region. You can view th=
e current sending rate and sending quota for your account on the Sending St=
atistics page of the Amazon SES console, or by using the GetSendQuota API.

As you get started with Amazon SES, keep in mind that you must:

- Comply with the AWS Acceptable Use Policy ( http://aws.amazon.com/aup/ ) =
and read the Amazon SES Service Terms (section Amazon Simple Email Service =
(SES) of http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/ ).

- Send only high-quality emails to recipients who expect to hear from you. =
For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperG=
uide/tips-and-best-practices.html.

- Set up a process to handle bounces and complaints. For more information, =
see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/bounce-complaint-n=
otifications.html.

- Use your new account to send a different type of email than you are sendi=
ng from your other account(s), if applicable. For more information, see htt=
p://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/multiple-accounts.html.

- Use the Amazon SES mailbox simulator to test your system so that your tes=
ting does not adversely impact your account. For more information, see http=
://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mailbox-simulator.html.

- Apply for higher sending limits before you need them. For more informatio=
n, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/manage-sending-quotas.html=
.

- With Amazon SES, you pay only for what you use. There are no contract neg=
otiations and no minimum charges. For more information see: https://aws.ama=
zon.com/ses/pricing/

Thank you for using Amazon Web Services.

We value your feedback. Please share your experience by rating this and oth=
