# Inbound - Project Overview

## What is Inbound?

**Inbound** is a modern email infrastructure platform designed for developers who need to programmatically handle email communication. It's essentially "email infrastructure that actually works the way you'd want it to" - providing programmable email addresses that automatically process incoming messages and trigger webhooks in your applications.

## Core Value Proposition

**"Stop juggling email providers. Start building."**

Inbound eliminates the complexity of traditional email providers by offering:

- üì® **Programmable Email Addresses** - Create email addresses that trigger webhooks when receiving emails
- üîÑ **Bidirectional Email** - Both send and receive emails programmatically
- üéØ **Smart Routing** - Route emails to different endpoints based on recipient
- üìä **Real-time Analytics** - Track email delivery, open rates, and webhook performance
- üõ°Ô∏è **Built-in Security** - Spam filtering, domain verification, and webhook authentication

## How It Works

### 1. Email Reception Flow
```
Incoming Email ‚Üí AWS SES ‚Üí Lambda Processing ‚Üí Webhook to Your App
```

1. **Email arrives** at your custom domain (e.g., support@yourdomain.com)
2. **AWS SES receives** the email and triggers a Lambda function  
3. **Lambda processes** the email (parsing, security checks, storage)
4. **Webhook fires** to your application with structured email data
5. **Your app responds** - could auto-reply, create tickets, process orders, etc.

### 2. Email Sending Flow
```
Your App ‚Üí Inbound API ‚Üí Email Service ‚Üí Recipient
```

- Send transactional emails via API
- Reply to received emails contextually
- Track delivery status and analytics

## Use Cases

### 1. Customer Support
```javascript
// Auto-route support emails and create tickets
if (email.to.includes('support@')) {
  await createSupportTicket(email)
  await sendAutoReply(email, 'Ticket created!')
}
```

### 2. Order Processing
```javascript
// Process order confirmations from suppliers
if (email.subject.includes('Order Confirmed')) {
  const orderData = parseOrderEmail(email.content)
  await updateInventory(orderData)
}
```

### 3. Lead Management
```javascript
// Capture leads from contact forms
if (email.to === 'leads@company.com') {
  await createLead(email.from, email.content)
  await sendToSalesTeam(email)
}
```

### 4. Notification Processing
```javascript
// Process system alerts and notifications
if (email.from.includes('alerts@')) {
  await processSystemAlert(email.content)
  await notifyOncallTeam(email)
}
```

## Recent Development Focus

### Migration to Structured Emails
The project is currently migrating from deprecated `receivedEmails` and `parsedEmails` tables to a new `structuredEmails` table with:
- Better type safety
- Cleaner data structure  
- Improved performance
- Enhanced querying capabilities

### V2 API Development
Building a comprehensive V2 API with:
- Unified endpoint structure
- Better error handling
- Improved type definitions
- OpenAPI documentation

### Features Architecture
Implementing a feature-based architecture following React Query best practices:
- Modular feature organization
- Custom hooks for data fetching
- Server actions integration
- Consistent query patterns

## Getting Started

### For Users
1. **Sign up** at inbound.new
2. **Add your domain** and verify DNS records
3. **Create email addresses** with webhook endpoints
4. **Install the SDK** and start receiving emails

### For Development
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**: `bun install`
3. **Set up environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
4. **Run development server**: `bun run dev`
5. **Test locally**: `bun run inbound-webhook-test test@domain.com`

## Business Model

## Why Inbound Exists

Traditional email providers are built for marketing, not developers. They focus on:
- ‚ùå Bulk sending capabilities
- ‚ùå Template editors and campaign management
- ‚ùå Marketing analytics and A/B testing

Inbound focuses on what developers actually need:
- ‚úÖ Reliable email reception and parsing
- ‚úÖ Webhook-driven architecture
- ‚úÖ Programmatic email handling
- ‚úÖ Real-time processing capabilities
- ‚úÖ Developer-friendly APIs and tooling
