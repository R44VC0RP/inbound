Project Rules:

- only use bun for package manager
- never run `bun run dev` or `bun run build` without my approval
- Before every message say "Rules Loaded: Primary (any others)"
- Never run npx tsc or any other build, type checker or anything else without my approval first. This will break the project. 
- We have depricated the `receivedEmails` and `parsedEmails` schema tables and we are wanted to replace them with `structuredEmails` which has better (cleaner) information and better typing. 
- You should NOT create duplicate type definitions, always try to find an existing type or find/extend one from a schema.
- All icons are using nucleo via MCP. 
- For all new functions and components you can create them in the API folder. Make sure to use the correct spec for the API.
