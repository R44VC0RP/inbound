When working on an API route it must have a 3-4 line description of what the API does on the top. 

For every API function like /api/(version)/domains there will be a:

- GET (retrieving information)
- POST (creating information)
- DELETE (deleting information)
- PUT (updating information)

## Authentication Pattern

Remember every API function must try to either auth via session or via API key.

Check if a session is valid first, then if there is no session check the request headers for an Authorization header.

If there is an Authorization header, check if it is a valid API key.

## Error Handling Standards

### Response Format
All API responses should follow a consistent format:
- Success: `{ success: true, data: {...} }`
- Error: `{ success: false, error: "message", details?: "additional info" }`

### Error Status Codes
- 400: Bad Request (validation errors, missing fields)
- 401: Unauthorized (invalid auth)
- 403: Forbidden (valid auth but insufficient permissions)
- 404: Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
- 409: Conflict (resource already exists)
- 500: Internal Server Error (unexpected errors)

### Error Logging
- Use console.log with emoji prefixes for better visibility
- Include operation context: `console.log('üìã GET /api/v1/endpoints - Fetching user endpoints')`
- Log errors with full context: `console.error('‚ùå POST /api/v1/endpoints - Error:', error)`

## Validation Requirements

### Input Validation
- Always validate required fields before processing
- Use type-safe validation (current: manual checks, future: Effect Schema)
- Validate data types and formats (URLs, emails, etc.)
- Return specific error messages for validation failures

Make sure the functions you use are in the lib/ folder, make sure if you are creating a new function or file that it is in the correct lib/xyz folder like a domain related function should be in lib/domain-and-dns/<filename>.ts
