When writing code, always apply the following style guide:

1. When you are using component files, always use a variant prop to apply the correct variant to the component. NEVER, NEVER, apply custom styles to the component like colors and sizes. You can use classname for spacing and layout.
2. Always use the correct color css variables for the component from global.css.
3. Never apply custom border radius to the components.
